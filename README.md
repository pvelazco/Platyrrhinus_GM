Code and data of "Geographic variation in select species of the bat genus Platyrrhinus" by Velazco, Ly, McAllister and Esquivel. THERYA, 2023, Vol 14(1):121-130. DOI:10.12933/therya-23-2208

This study evaluates the variation in cranial shape and size based on geometric morphometric analyses of Platyrrhinus dorsalis and P. umbratus.
2D geometric morphometric data was used to evaluate whether the populations of P. dorsalis and P. umbratus deserve subspecific recognition or that the external and craniodental morphological differences between the populations of these two species is the result of an altitudinal or latitudinal cline.

We analyzed dorsal and ventral views of the skulls of Platyrrhinus dorsalis (populations assigned to dorsalis and chocoensis) and P. umbratus (populations assigned to nigellus and umbratus).

We performed analyses in four data sets:
- Platyrrhinus dorsalis: dorsal (1) and ventral (2) views of the skull.
- Platyrrhinus umbratus: dorsal (3) and ventral (4) views of the skull.
